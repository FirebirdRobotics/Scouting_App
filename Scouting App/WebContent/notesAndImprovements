	> have an instantaneous checker for robotNumber so that people in scouting don't have to communicate with each other
	> need pit scouting
	> record the user who scouted the robot & implement rewards system (make it something fun ex. display top 3 scouting team on home page)
	> fix the profile page (profile picture)
	> fix styles for ios (on iphone the dropdown and text fields have weird borders and stuff)
	> add a type for the match number (qualification/quarterfinals/semifinals/finals)
	> make it an average rank instead of accumulative
