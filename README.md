THINGS TO DO:
 1) fix small UI issues (tab bar/side bar is offset)
 2) update scouting app w/ branding guide
 3) data analysis (find some online tool that u can link)
 4) make usable for people who don't know HTML/CSS (this is a really big project, i don't expect to get this done for a while)


Note to self: remember to change the database location to the actual database
