# Scouting App
This is the code for the web-based Scouting App/Tool for the Firebird Robotics team. Programmed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL

## For learning the scouting app:

Dear members of the Firebird Robotics Club,

If you wish to learn about the scouting app, I have created a 46-page guide that entails just about everything that you'll need know, which has been attached to this project. If you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me by email at yang.branden@gmail.com. While I did create the scouting app in my freshman year, I can't say that I remember every single detail about it, so for the more technical stuff like "How do I change the name of the variables?" or "What does this specific syntax mean?", you're probably better off just using google and stackoverflow (as that's how I made the app in the first place).

I hope that this project will help the club, and if you decide to use some other method of scouting, that's completely fine with me. I am not personally actively updating the scouting app, and will leave this version of the code untouched. 

Thanks,
Branden Yang
